// Availability windows for assessments (quizzes/worksheets + assignments) and
// the materials-for-review policy (user-signed decisions, 2026-10-06).
//
// WHY PURE TYPESCRIPT: the pg compat layer (src/integrations/db/client.server.ts)
// can only express eq/gte/ilike/is/in filters — it cannot express the required
// `opens_at IS NULL OR opens_at <= now()` predicate. Rows are therefore fetched
// unfiltered and gated here in TypeScript after the fetch. Do NOT extend the
// compat layer (Gate-1 amendment #1); this module is also the seam for future
// auth centralization (C13).
//
// POLICIES:
//  * DEADLINES HARD-BLOCK EVERYTHING — attempts and submissions are rejected
//    before `opens_at` and after the deadline (quizzes: `closes_at`; assignments:
//    `due_date` and/or `closes_at` — the earliest configured deadline wins).
//    No late flag, no overwrite.
//  * MATERIALS FOR REVIEW — enrolled students download course materials once
//    ANY referencing assessment has opened (null opens_at = always) and RETAIN
//    access afterward. No attempt-gating, no re-locking.
//
// BOUNDARY SEMANTICS: a window is open while `opens_at <= now <= deadline`
// (inclusive on both ends). "Closed" means the deadline has *passed* — a submit
// exactly at the deadline is accepted, one second later is hard-blocked.
